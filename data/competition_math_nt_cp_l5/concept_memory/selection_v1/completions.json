This suggests we can express $A$ and $B$ in terms of a common scaling factor $k$. Specifically, $A = 3k$ and $B = 7k$. Since 3 and 7 are coprime, $k$ will correspond to the greatest common divisor of $A$ and $B$.

This implies that the fractional part of $\\log_{10} N$, denoted as $\\{\\log_{10} N\\}$, must satisfy $0 \\le \\{\\log_{10} N\\} < \\log_{10} 2$.\n\n2.  **Application to Powers of 5**: For $N = 5^k$, we have $\\log_{10} (5^k) = k \\log_{10} 5$. The condition becomes $0 \\le \\{k \\log_{10} 5\\} < \\log_{10} 2$.\n    Note that $\\log_{10} 5 = 1 - \\log_{10} 2$. Let $\\alpha = \\log_{10} 2 \\approx 0.3010$. Then $\\log_{10} 5 = 1 - \\alpha$.\n    The fractional part is $\\{k(1-\\alpha)\\} = \\{k - k\\alpha\\} = \\{-k\\alpha\\} = 1 - \\{k\\alpha\\}$ (unless $k\\alpha$ is an integer, which it isn't for $k>0$).\n    So the condition $0 \\le \\{k \\log_{10} 5\\} < \\alpha$ translates to $0 \\le 1 - \\{k\\alpha\\} < \\alpha$, which simplifies to $1-\\alpha < \\{k\\alpha\\} \\le 1$.\n    Alternatively, we can directly use the property that the leading digit is determined by the fractional part of the logarithm.\n\n3.  **Relevant Concepts**:\n    *   **Leading Digit via Logarithmic Fractional Part**: This concept directly addresses finding the leading digit of large numbers (like $5^k$) by analyzing the fractional part of their logarithm ($\\log_{10} 5^k = k \\log_{10} 5$). The cues \"Problem asks for the leading digit of a large power\" and \"Direct computation of the number is infeasible\" match perfectly.\n    *   **Iterative Accumulation**: Since we need to count the number of such $k$ in the range $0 \\le k \\le 2004$, we will likely iterate through these values (or use a property of the distribution, but given the specific bounds and the nature of competition problems, an accumulation loop or a derived count based on the total digits is standard). The cues \"loop over a range\", \"running total\", and \"Counting elements that satisfy a boolean predicate\" fit the process of checking each $k$ and summing the valid ones.\n    *   **Conditional Counting**: This is the specific logic of incrementing a counter only when the condition (leading digit is 1) is met. The cues \"Goal is to count the number of elements satisfying a specific property\" and \"Logic involves a boolean predicate inside an iteration\" are relevant.\n    *   **Base-b Digit Count Formula**: The problem gives the number of digits of $5^{2004}$ as 1401. The number of digits $D$ of $5^k$ is $\\lfloor k \\log_{10} 5 \\rfloor + 1$. This information might be used to verify bounds or relate the total count to the number of digits, although the primary method is the logarithmic fractional part. The cue \"Calculate the number of base-2 digits\" (generalizable to base 10) and \"floor\" are relevant.\n\nThe most critical and specific concept is **Leading Digit via Logarithmic Fractional Part**. The counting mechanism relies on **Conditional Counting** or **Iterative Accumulation**.\n\n```yaml\n- Leading Digit via Logarithmic Fractional Part\n- Conditional Counting\n- Iterative Accumulation\n- Base-b Digit Count Formula\n```",
  "cmath_5354": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of integers $n > 1$ such that the decimal expansion of $1/n$ is purely periodic with a period that divides 12. The condition $d_i = d_{i+12}$ for all $i$ implies that the period length $k$ of the repeating decimal satisfies $k \\mid 12$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the relevant concepts:\n\n1.  **Decimal Expansion and Periodicity**: The problem involves the decimal representation of $1/n$. Specifically, it mentions an \"infinite decimal\" with a repeating pattern ($d_i = d_{i+12}$). This relates to the **Terminating Decimal Criterion** (to ensure it's infinite/repeating, the denominator must have prime factors other than 2 and 5) and the theory of repeating decimals where the period length is related to the multiplicative order of 10 modulo $n$.\n\n2.  **Purely Periodic Condition**: The condition $d_i = d_{i+12}$ for *all* $i \\ge 1$ implies the decimal is purely periodic (no non-repeating prefix). This happens if and only if $\\gcd(n, 10) = 1$. If $\\gcd(n, 10) > 1$, there would be a pre-period. Thus, we must count $n$ coprime to 10. This involves **Coprimality Check**.\n\n3.  **Period Length Constraint**: For a purely periodic decimal $1/n$, the period length is the multiplicative order of 10 modulo $n$, denoted as $\\text{ord}_n(10)$. The condition that the digits repeat every 12 places means $\\text{ord}_n(10)$ must divide 12. This is a **Modular Arithmetic** problem involving the order of an element.\n\n4.  **Divisibility Condition**: The condition $\\text{ord}_n(10) \\mid 12$ is equivalent to $10^{12} \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$. This transforms the problem into finding the number of divisors of $10^{12} - 1$ that satisfy specific constraints ($\\gcd(n, 10)=1$ and $n > 1$). This suggests using **Divisor Enumeration** or **Divisor Counting Formula**.\n\n5.  **Factorization**: To count the divisors, we need the prime factorization of $10^{12} - 1$.\n    $10^{12} - 1 = (10^6 - 1)(10^6 + 1) = (10^3-1)(10^3+1)(10^2+1)(10^4-10^2+1)$.\n    We know $10^3-1 = 999 = 27 \\times 37 = 3^3 \\times 37$.\n    $10^3+1 = 1001 = 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n    $10^2+1 = 101$ (prime).\n    $10^4-10^2+1 = 9901$. The problem states **9901 is prime**.\n    So, $10^{12} - 1 = 3^3 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 \\times 37 \\times 101 \\times 9901$.\n    This step relies on **Prime Factorization** and potentially algebraic identities like **Difference of Squares** or sum/difference of cubes.\n\n6.  **Counting Valid Divisors**: We need to count divisors $n$ of $10^{12}-1$ such that $\\gcd(n, 10) = 1$. Since the prime factors of $10^{12}-1$ are all odd and not 5 (checking: 3, 7, 11, 13, 37, 101, 9901 are none of 2 or 5), *all* divisors of $10^{12}-1$ are coprime to 10.\n    Thus, the problem reduces to counting the total number of divisors of $10^{12}-1$ and subtracting 1 (since $n > 1$).\n    This uses the **Divisor Counting Formula**.\n\n7.  **Exclusion of Non-Coprime Cases**: Although in this specific case all divisors work, the general logic involves checking the **Terminating Decimal Criterion**",
